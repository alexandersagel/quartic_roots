# Quartic Roots

C++ implementation (with Matlab and Python bindings) of the analytical solution for real-valued zeros of polynomials of degree 4 via the general formula as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function)

NOTE: Numerical instabilities [have been observed](https://github.com/alexandersagel/quartic_roots/issues/1) in the implemented method
